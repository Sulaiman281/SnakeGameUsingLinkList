this project was given by aamir soomro my classmate but i couldn't make it b/c i don't know about graphical programming that much i tried but it was hard for me 
but i will make it
Now what does futures requruied in library management software?
Books/ addbook  ... is that book aviable or not.... issued ? then who has that book?
Student ..... or a member ......  add student ...... check details ..... how many books he had issued ..
there should be a limit the number of books can be issued max 2 books can be issued ......
and the book should be return within 15 days if the student don't return book on time then he should be fine and on every 5th day the find should increase
and a notification to manager that a student haven't return the book and to the student you have issued "BookName" on "DATE" Kindly return the book within 5 days or you will be fined and fined will increase on every 5thday day 

okay that's what i need i guess in the library management
